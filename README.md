# International Student Mobility (STAT250 Final Project)

This project analyzes the impact of various national-level factors on international student mobility in tertiary education.
Conducted using real-world data from the OECD, UNICEF, and World Bank, it explores whether GDP expenditure on education and literacy rates significantly influence the outflow of students from different countries and continents.

##  Methods

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive Statistics
- Hypothesis Testing
- Multiple Linear Regression
- ANOVA & Tukey HSD Test

All analyses were performed using RStudio.

## Key Findings

-  **Asia** has the highest number of international students globally.
-  Literacy rates vary across continents, with **Africa** showing the most variability.
- Female literacy rates tend to show lower outliers than males.
-  Regression models suggest **literacy** and **continent** are significant predictors of student mobility.
-  More than **50% of international students in 2021 came from Asia**.
- ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ vs ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ The proportion of international students from the US and UK is significantly different.
